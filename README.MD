# Sample Selenium Project

Basic Python3 with Selenium Webdriver on To-Do List (Angular application) with macOS. Code could be improved with better exposure to Python-Selenium library, lesser reliance on bad practices like sleep, etc.

## Setup

* Ensure Python3 is downloaded and installed with macOS
* Set up new virtualenv with `python3 -m venv .env`
* Activate virtualenv with `source .env/bin/activate`
* Download dependencies with `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
* Download Chrome Webdriver from Chronium. For unzipping guide, refer to [@here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38081021/using-selenium-on-mac-chrome)
* Execute script with `pytest -s script.py`
